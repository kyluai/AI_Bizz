                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        ScaleMako was born from a simple idea: what if we could help businesses grow while learning and building something meaningful ourselves?
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        We're two college students who saw a gap in the market. Small businesses need AI automation solutions, but they're often too expensive or too complex. At the same time, we wanted to gain real world experience building products that actually help people.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        So we decided to combine both goals. We're building ScaleMako to help others grow their businesses while we gain valuable experience and build our own.
