## 2. PROPRIETARY "ACTIVITY LEVEL" PRICING MATH

### Base Pricing (Low Activity Level)
These are the starting prices for businesses with new/low volume operations:

| Service | Setup Fee (Range) | Monthly Fee |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Voice Receptionists** | $497 - $797 | $97/mo |
| **Chat Assistants** | $297 - $497 | $49/mo |
| **Custom SEO Website Build** | $997 - $1,497 | $49/mo |
| **Workflow Automations** | $397 - $697 | $29/mo |

### Activity Level Multipliers

**Low Activity (Just Starting / New / Low Volume):**
- Setup Multiplier: 1.0x (base price)
- Monthly Multiplier: 1.0x (base price)

**Medium Activity (Steady Flow / Consistent Leads):**
- Setup Multiplier: 1.5x (50% increase)
- Monthly Multiplier: 1.5x (50% increase)

**High Activity (Overwhelmed / High Call/Chat Volume):**
- Setup Multiplier: 2.5x (150% increase)
- Monthly Multiplier: 3.0x (200% increase)

### Pricing Calculation Example

**Example: Voice Receptionists for Medium Activity Business**

## 3. "REPLACES" ROI LOGIC

### Traditional Human Role Costs

ScaleMako services replace traditional employee roles at the following monthly costs:

| Traditional Role | Monthly Cost | Replaced By |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Full-time Receptionist** | $3,200/mo | Voice Receptionists |
| **Customer Support Agent / Support Rep** | $2,800/mo | Chat Assistants |
| **Web Developer Retainer** | $1,500/mo | Custom SEO Website Build |
| **Admin Assistant** | $2,500/mo | Workflow Automations |

### ROI Calculation Formula

**Monthly Savings = Traditional Role Cost - ScaleMako Monthly Cost**

**Annual Savings = Monthly Savings × 12**

**Example Calculation:**
- Traditional Receptionist: $3,200/mo
- ScaleMako Voice (Low Activity): $97/mo
- **Monthly Savings: $3,103/mo**
- **Annual Savings: $37,236/year**

### Financial Impact Summary

When calculating savings for multiple services:
1. **Subtotal** = Sum of all traditional role costs being replaced
2. **ScaleMako Total** = Sum of all ScaleMako monthly fees (after activity level multipliers)
3. **Monthly Savings** = Subtotal - ScaleMako Total
4. **Annual Savings** = Monthly Savings × 12

**Important:** The subtotal represents the total cost of traditional employees/services that ScaleMako replaces. This is the baseline for calculating ROI.
